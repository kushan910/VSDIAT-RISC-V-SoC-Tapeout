Welcome to my journey through the **VSDIAT RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**!  

This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks inside each week.  

> *"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools.  
> It is part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon  
> and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem."*
